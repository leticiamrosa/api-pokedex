**PokeApi Typescript** ðŸ‘‹
---
This project is under construct.

The idea of this project its developer a node application with typescript consuming the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) for later build some front-end application for web and mobile.

I already have a [Pokedex](https://github.com/leticiamrosa/pokedex) its a web application, but when i was development this other project i had to put the logic of compose data in the front-end with two endpoints of two differences apis for create the data i want to for use in the front-end.

This is not cool to do, I know that, so I decide to do this other project, to fix and increase my skills in the back-end side.
